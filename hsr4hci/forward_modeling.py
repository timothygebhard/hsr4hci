    """
    Add a fake planet to the given `stack` which, when derotating and
    merging the stack, will show up at the given `position`.

    This function can also be used to *remove* planets from a stack by
    setting the `psf_scaling` to a negative number.

    If you simply want to use this function to generate a fake signal
    stack, set `stack` to all zeros, the `magnitude` to zero, both the
    `dit_stack` and `dit_psf_template` to 1 (or any other non-zero
    number), and use the `extra_scaling` factor to linearly control
    the brightness of the injected planet.

    This function is essentially a simplified port of the corresponding
    PynPoint function `pynpoint.util.analysis.fake_planet()`.

    Args:
        stack: A 3D numpy array of shape `(n_frames, width, height)`
            which contains the stack of images / frames into which we
            want to inject a fake planet.
        parang: A 1D numpy array of shape `(n_frames, )` that contains
            the respective parallactic angle for every frame in `stack`.
        psf_template: A 2D numpy array that contains the (centered) PSF
            template which will be used for the fake planet.
            This should *not* be normalized to (0, 1] if we want to work
            with actual astrophysical magnitudes for the contrast.
        polar_position: A tuple `(separation, angle)` which specifies
            the position at which the planet will show up after
            de-rotating with `parang`. `separation` needs to be a
            Quantity that can be converted to pixel; `angle` needs to
            be a Quantity that can be converted to radian. Additionally,
            `angle` should be using *astronomical* polar coordinates,
            that is, 0 degrees will be "up" (= North), not "right".
            This function will internally add 90Â° to the angles to
            convert them to mathematical pilar coordinates.
        magnitude: The magnitude difference used to scale the PSF.
            Note: This is the contrast ratio in *magnitudes*, meaning
            that increasing this value by a factor of 5 will result in
            a planet that is 100 times brighter. In case you want to
            keep things linear, set this value to 0 and only use the
            `psf_scaling` parameter.
        extra_scaling: An additional scaling factor that is used for
            the PSF template.
            This number is simply multiplied with the PSF template,
            meaning that it changes the brightness linearly, not on a
            logarithmic scale. For example, you could use `-1` to add a
            *negative* planet to remove an actual planet in the data.
            This can also be used to incorporate an additional dimming
            factor due to a
        dit_stack: The detector integration time of the frames in the
            `stack` (in seconds). Necessary to compute the correct
            scaling factor for the planet that we inject.
        dit_psf_template: The detector integration time of the
            `psf_template` (in seconds). Necessary to compute the
            correct scaling factor for the planet that we inject.
        return_planet_positions: Whether to return the (Cartesian)
            positions at which the fake planet was injected, as a
            2D numpy array of shape `(n_frames, 2)`.
        interpolation: interpolation argument that is passed to the
            `scipy.ndimage.shift()` routine that is used internally.

    Returns:
        A 3D numpy array of shape `(n_frames, width, height)` which
        contains the original `stack` into which a fake planet has been
        injected, as well as a list of tuples `(x, y)` that, for each
        frame, contain the position at which the fake planet has been
        added.
        If desired, additionally also a 2D numpy array of shape
        `(n_frames, 2)` containing the Cartesian positions at which
        the fake planet has been injected.

    Compute the expected signal time series for a pixel at `position`
    under the assumption that the planet signal is centered on this
    pixel at the given `signal_time`.

    If we are only interested in a single such time series, using this
    function will be *dramatically* faster than computing the full stack
    using `get_signal_stack()` and selecting the position of interest.

    The idea behind this function is that we can get the time series of
    interest (or a reasonably good approximation of it) by creating a
    single frame of all zeros, into which we place the PSF template at
    the target `position`, and then sample this array along the implied
    path (determined by the fact that the signal is supposed to be at
    `position` at the `signal_time`) of the planet. This avoids the
    computationally expensive generation of the full stack (of which
    only a single spatial pixel would be used). The exact speed-up of
    this version depends on the number of frames, but is typically on
    the order of a factor of 10^2 to 10^3.

    Note: This function uses the *numpy convention* for `position`!

        position: A tuple `(x, y)` for which we want to compute the

        frame_size: A tuple `(x_size, y_size)` giving the spatial size
            of the stack.

            every frame.
        psf_template: A numpy array containing the cropped and masked
            PSF template, as it is returned by `crop_psf_template()`.

            `shift_image()` function. Default is "bilinear".
