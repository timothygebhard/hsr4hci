## âš¡ Quickstart

To get started, clone this repository and install `hsr4hci` as a Python package:

```
git clone git@github.com:timothygebhard/hsr4hci.git
cd hsr4hci
pip install .
```

If you want to use "developer options" (e.g., run unit tests), change the last line to:

```
pip install .[develop]
```

To run any experiments or reproduce our results, you will first need to create some data sets in the right format.
Please check out the [README file in the `datasets` directory](https://github.com/timothygebhard/hsr4hci/tree/master/datasets) for more information on how to do this.
