## ‚ö° Quickstart

To get started, clone this repository and install `hsr4hci` as a Python package:

```
git clone git@github.com:timothygebhard/hsr4hci.git
cd hsr4hci
pip install .
```

If you want to use "developer options" (e.g., run unit tests), change the last line to:

```
pip install .[develop]
```

To run any experiments or reproduce our results, you will first need to create some data sets in the right format.
Please check out the [README file in the `datasets` directory](https://github.com/timothygebhard/hsr4hci/tree/master/datasets) for more information on how to do this.


## üß™ (Re)-running our experiments

All of our experiments can be found in the `experiments` directory.
For some experiments (e.g., the mini-experiments from the appendix), the respective subdirectory will already contain all the scripts needed to run the experiment (e.g., a `make_plot.py` script).
This is also true for "evaluation scripts" which are only applicable to a specific experiment.

Experiments that use a workflow that can be recycled across various experiments (e.g., running our half-sibling regression algorithm) typically consist of a `config.json` file that specifies the exact experiment configuration (data set, algorithm, hyperparameters, ...). 
To run the experiments, we use the scripts in the `scripts/experiments` directory.
There are two main ways of running the half-sibling regression pipeline:
1. The version in `scripts/experiments/multiple-scripts`, where the pipeline is broken up into multiple scripts. 
   This is useful, for example, if you want to run experiments in parallel on a cluster. 
2. The version in `scripts/experiments/single-script`, which contains the entire pipeline in a single file.

To give a practical example, here is the command that you need to re-run the first experiment using HSR with signal fitting on the Beta Pictoris L' data set:
```bash
python scripts/experiments/single-script/01_run_pipeline.py --experiment-dir experiments/01_first-results/signal_fitting/beta_pictoris__lp
```

Scripts named `00_make_submit_files.py` can be used to create submission files for running our experiments on a [HTCondor-based cluster](https://htcondor.org/) with [DAGMan](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/htcondor/dagman/dagman.html).

## üê≠ Tests

To further improve reproducibility of our results, this repository comes with an extensive set of unit and integration tests (based on [`pytest`](https://pytest.org)). 
After installing `hsr4hci`, the tests can be run as:
```
pytest tests
```
