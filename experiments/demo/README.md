# ðŸ§ª Demo experiment

This folder contains a small demo experiment to help you get started with using the methods from this repository.
It is essentially a simplified version of experiment 5.1 from our paper that uses a smaller temporal grid and a heavily binned version of our Beta Pictoris *L'* data set to make sure it runs quickly even on a single machine.

1. Before you get started, make sure that `hsr4hci` and its dependencies are installed (ideally in a [virtual environment](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) to avoid any version conflicts between Python packages). 
2. If you have not done so already, [download the data sets](https://doi.org/10.17617/3.LACYPN) and place them in the right (sub)-directories, as described [here](https://github.com/timothygebhard/hsr4hci/tree/master/datasets).
3. Now, to start and run the experiment, use:
   ```
   python <path>/hsr4hci/scripts/experiments/single-script/01_run_pipeline.py --experiment-dir <path>/experiments/demo 
   ```
   (Replace the `<path>` with the correct path to the `hsr4hci` repository.) 
4. Depending on your hardware, the experiment should take about 10 to 20 minutes to run.
   (If you find this too long, you can, for example, open the `config.json` and try to increase the `binning_factor` further.)
5. Once they experiment has finished, you can find the results in `./plots`.
   The signal estimate is stored as a FITS file, which you can view, for example, using [SAOImageDS9](https://sites.google.com/cfa.harvard.edu/saoimageds9).
6. You can also generate a plot as a PDF by calling the following script:
   ```
   python <path>/scripts/experiments/evaluate-and-plot/evaluate_and_plot_signal_estimate.py --experiment-dir ./experiments/demo
   ```
   You will find the final result plot in `./plots`.
